*This project is a Chrome Extension built to monitor and analyze user activity across different websites. It tracks the time spent on each tab, classifies websites as productive or unproductive, and sends this data to a backend server for analysis.

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express, while the frontend is implemented as a lightweight Chrome extension using JavaScript. Time tracking is done in real-time using Chromeâ€™s tabs API, and data is sent via POST requests to the backend server running on localhost.*
